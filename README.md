# Proposition for Challenge "Predict Sex from brain Rhythms" by Dreem

You find here the report summarizing our three solutions for the Dreem Machine Learning Challenge about prediciting sex from brain rhythms. This challenge was part of our academic project in Machine Learning Course at Ecole Centrale de Lyon by Professor Yohann De Castro. 

In the PDF file, we explain our methodology and how we worked using three ways to solve the problem and all the sub-problems we faced in this challenge. I have added also some parts of the code in the report.

You can check the details of the challenge from [HERE](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/27).
For questions, discussion or propositions you can contact me directly on my academic email from [HERE](anass.el-houd@ecl19.ec-lyon.fr)
